This repository will be the tracking of myy she codes journey to become a software developer
From Monday the 27th of March , i shall begin my journey to becoming a software development / Front-end Developer 
With that being said this repository has been created to track that journey and make sure that i continously track my progress as an individual trying to make it into tech. 
Follow this journey with me.

The journey has started , and so far it has been good i would rather say that this journey has rather been smooth sailing but hey is day 2 i cant say much , it was been a freshers course for me andi am honestly loving it. Hopefully i keep this motivaton till the end

Day 3:
Today we learnt element of CSS and how to position it to our pages to customize and create a page that looks more presentable and unique. Today , i gained an ampile amountof information thathas left me to feel that i am able to create my own basic structure of a website

Week 1 : HTML & CSS
This week was filled with an amplitude of knowledge allowing me to be able to create a replication of a weather webpage, it was an experience that left me confident at myskills asa coder and im excited for the journey ahead.

Week 2 : Javascript 
This week we learning Javascript and it has started with the internal javascript that is intergratedwithin HTML and it is going well so far and it is an interesting process that intrigues my mind on the fact that there is more than just html and css that go into making a page work in every sense and as well as allowing us to communicate with certain enginges within  a computer.

Week 3: Final project with integation of HTML,CSS & JS
The project indicated that i needed to create a website that incoporated the above mentioned things and it was honestly one of the best things in terms of my confidence in tech i regards to myself and what i can produce , just from that project i was able to see what i am capable of as well as the ideas in which i have in regards to the improvements i would want to make on that webpage.

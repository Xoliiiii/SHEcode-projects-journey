WEATHER APP
This weather app has been built over weeks, including HTML, CSS & JS.
The app has been hosted on Netlify. 
The primary purpose of the app is to provide, accurate tracing of the current location and provide the user with the time.
Adaptation in terms of figuring out the weather for specific geolocation provided by the user changes on user input and provides an automatic response
Creation of certain limitations in terms of what the user puts in can be done over time, as anything the user puts in as the "city", is automatically logged into the app without the consequence of an error even if what the user inputted is wrong. 
The current location button doesn't work as functionality towards it has not been inputted therefore meaning the current location, temp is set on the automation view of the application.

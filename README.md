# SHEcode-projects-journey
This repository will be the tracking of myy she codes journey to become a software developer
From Monday the 27th of March , i shall begin my journey to becoming a software development / Front-end Developer 
With that being said this repository has been created to track that journey and make sure that i continously track my progress as an individual trying to make it into tech. 
Follow this journey with me.

The journey has started , and so far it has been good i would rather say that this journey has rather been smooth sailing but hey is day 2 i cant say much , it was been a freshers course for me andi am honestly loving it. Hopefully i keep this motivaton till the end
